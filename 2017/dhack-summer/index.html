	<h2>About Camp</h2>
	<p>During  the Dhack Institute Summer STEM Camp 2017, we were taught the basics of building a website using HTML. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Each student was given the opportunity to create their own webpage and learnt various things like:
		<ul>
			<li>HTML default template</li>
			<li>Different HTML tags such as p, br, hr, h1</li>
			<li>Difference between tags that have both opening and closing tags versus tags that only have opening tags e.g. "i" vs "hr"</li>
			<li>Links</li>
			<li>Images</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>We also learnt about CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS deals with the presentation of a website including adding colors, changing font types and sizes and generally beautifying a website.</p>
